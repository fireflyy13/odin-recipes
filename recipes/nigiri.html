    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nigiri sushi is that familiar style of sushi made up of an oval-shaped mound of rice with a slice of (usually) raw fish on top.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Japanese short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2-inch piece kombu (optional)</li>
        <li> ⅓ cup rice vinegar, plus more for shaping</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoon kosher or sea salt</li>
        <li>30 slices sushi-grade raw fish and/or tamagoyaki</li>
        <li>Wasabi paste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Make the sushi rice. In a large bowl, use your fingers to wash the</p>
            <p>rice with cold water until the water is almost clear, changing the</p>
            <p>water frequently (about 4–8 times). Soak the clean rice in fresh cold</p>
            <p>water for 30 minutes. Drain the rice in a fine-mesh sieve.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cook the rice on the stovetop or in an electric rice cooker with the</p>
            <p>kombu. If cooking on the stovetop, combine the rice and 2 cups of</p>
            <p>water in a medium pot over medium heat. Cover and bring to a boil,</p>
            <p>then reduce the heat to low and cook until the water is completely</p>
            <p>absorbed—about 12 minutes. If using a rice cooker, use the “sushi”</p>
            <p>setting if available and the amount of water indicated for three cups</p>
            <p>of rice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt over</p>
            <p>medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and whisk until the sugar</p>
            <p>dissolves.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Wet the inside of a large bowl with a damp cloth and transfer the</p>
            <p>cooked rice to the slightly wet bowl, leaving behind any rice that’s</p>
            <p>stuck to the bottom of the pot. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the</p>
            <p>rice. Use a wooden spoon or plastic rice paddle to slice through the</p>
            <p>rice at a 45-degree angle, flipping the rice over in between strokes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once the rice is completely mixed, cover the bowl with a clean,</p>
            <p>damp kitchen towel until ready to use. You want warm rice when</p>
            <p>making sushi.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare a small bowl of ice water with a splash of rice vinegar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Dip your hands into the water and use your damp hands to grab a</p>
            <p>small ball of sushi rice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Using your hands, form the rice into a rectangle about as long as</p>
            <p>one slice of fish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Using a chopstick, place a small dab of wasabi paste on the center</p>
            <p>of the rice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Top the rice ball with a slice of fish and gently squeeze the rice and</p>
            <p>fish together in one hand, using the index finger of your other hand</p>
            <p>to keep the fish in place.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Repeat steps 7–10 with the remaining fish and rice.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
